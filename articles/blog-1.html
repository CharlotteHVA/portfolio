                <h3>Hey there and welcome!</h3>
                <p>Thanks for getting involved. This space is all about the things I love most: making things with pixels, bringing ideas to life through code, and, of course, sipping coffee while doing it all. I'm a web developer and digital creator. I'm passionate about thoughtful design, clean development, and experimenting with what the web can be.</p>

                <h3>So, let me tell you why I built this portfolio.</h3>
                <p>This site is for all your project needs. It's my digital playground — where I test ideas, refine visuals and combine logic with creativity. I'm always curious about what happens when design meets function, whether it's designing a website using only shapes and colour, building a custom reading app, or exploring the 3D world through Blender.</p>

                    <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
                    <p>This blog is where I'll sometimes share:</p>
                    <p>→ Some details about the design/development process. <br>
                    → Some behind-the-scenes sketches, wireframes and prototypes. <br>
                    → Learning about tools, techniques and failures that turn into something cool. <br>
                    → Projects I'm currently working on for school, clients or just for fun.</p>
                    <p>Some posts might be polished. Others might be messy. That's the fun part – it's all part of growing as a maker.</p>

                <h3>Let's get creative and make something awesome!</h3>
                <p>If you're into web design, digital experiments, or just like seeing how things are made, I hope this space gives you something to take with you. Whether you're a creative, someone we're working with or you've just dropped by for a coffee, thanks for joining.</p>
                <p>Let's build something meaningful. More to come soon.</p>
